# Welcome to Winfo
An application (for water sports) that uses values measured by weather stations.

### Set up
To make this app work directly in python you need to install the requirements.txt packages


For the background tasks, you need to run the "double_clickez_ici_pour_installer_winfo.bat" file. It creates a new .bat file in the `shell:startup` folder to start the 2 background tasks.

For now, it only works on Windows (or you have to remove the 'from windows-toasts import ...' in 'Winfo.py' and 'winfo_import.py' and everything will work except the notifications).

Then you're good to go (hopefully)
