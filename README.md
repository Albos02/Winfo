# Welcome to Winfo
An application (for water sports) that uses values measured by weather stations.

To make this app work directly in python you need to install those packages :

`pip install customtkinter tkintermapview ctktable windows-toasts keyboard`


For the background tasks, you need to run the "double_clickez_ici_pour....bat" file. It creates a new .bat file in the `shell:startup` folder


then you're good to go (hopefully)



if you want the .exe version, visit my [Website](https://louse-proud-raven.ngrok-free.app)
